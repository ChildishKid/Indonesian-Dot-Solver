# Indonesian Dot - Puzzle Solver

## Introduction

The Indonesian Dot Puzzle is played on a n x n board. On each position of the board, a wooden token is placed.
Each token has 2 sides: one with a white dot (w), and the other with a black dot (b). Initially, the tokens are
placed on the board on a random side, and the goal is to find the smallest number of moves to bring the board
to its goal configuration, where all tokens have their white side up (w).

## Dependencies

No additional modules are needed for running the application

## Instructions

    ```

2. Run the python module 'indonesian_dot.py':
    ```shell script
    py indonesian_dot.py
